# Vector-Surveil
Basically its a surveillance project in which resources like heatmap and openstreet maps are used. It can be used to detect faces along with emotions and locations. So suppose if i give this to a college and the college has the data of each student so it can use the cctv cameras and with the help of this surveili it can detect each student.
